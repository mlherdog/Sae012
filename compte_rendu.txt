For begin with, we will make the bref the objectives of this project. it's a project where we have to sort des depeche in categories. 
For this we should before create the lexicon ourself. And after we  generate them automatically by algorythme.
  
In this project, we had to in first ,make one piece of code for the basis of the project. Create the class "Categorie" and "PaireChaineEntier". That will serve us all time in the next step.

The second step is  to create several algorithm :
- Many simple functions for make different thing. In The class "UtilitairePaireChaineEntier".
- An algorithm to sort dispatches by category, thanks to the words of a lexicon. Then compare the results we found with the true category of that dispatch.and write they results in file.

The third step is create automatically the lexicon of words, that we create ourselves before.
For the lexicon automatically we have need to create the fonctions. "initDico","calculScores","poidsPourScore" and "generationLexique".


The last step consists of test and upgrade ours algo. 
- Try to reduce the number of errors.
- Reduce the time of execution.
- Reduce the number of comparisons of our algo.

  // presentation of result
We will see the presentation of the results of the algorithm on the different lexicons:

In first place we look the result of algorithm on the ourself lexicons:
- The result of the good answers: 
    SPORTS:95%
    CULTURE:2%
    POLITIQUE:37%
    ECONOMIE:21%
    ENVIRONNEMENT-SCIENCES:0%
    MOYENNE:31.0%
   Is not a verry good result because creating the lexicon takes a lot of time, And this not great importance for the following.
-The execution time is between 60ms and 80ms (I'm running my code on my old laptop, maybe this has a consequence on the time)
-The number of comparisons of my code is 91170 comparaisons.

Now let's see the result of algorithm on the lexicons created automatically.
-The result of good answers
  SPORTS:85%
  CULTURE:70%
  POLITIQUE:70%
  ECONOMIE:68%
  ENVIRONNEMENT-SCIENCES:61%
  MOYENNE:70.0%
It’s a decent score but it’s not perfect yet. I know I can still improve it but we will talk about it later in this report.
